This directory contains 8 exercises, which you can use to practice Bash and Linux.

In case you want to reset a directory to its initial state (e.g. because you have accidentally deleted something or you want to do the exercise again) you can use the command

./reset <dir_name>

in this directory.

To reset all exercises, you can use the command:

./reset all

Have fun!
