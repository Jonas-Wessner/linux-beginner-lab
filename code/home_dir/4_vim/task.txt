1. Create a file called 'lets_go_vim.txt'
2. Use vim to edit the file 'lets_go_vim.txt' and change its contents to 'Hello Vim!'
3. Look at the modified file using the cat command
4. Use Vim to replace all numbers with dots in the file 'shopping_list.txt' by hyphens (-). E.g. the first line should look like this '- Water'.
5. Delete the entry with cream in the file 'shopping_list.txt'
6. Use the command './check.sh' in this directory to verify your results

NOTE: Do not add any extra white spaces in the files for the check command to work properly.
