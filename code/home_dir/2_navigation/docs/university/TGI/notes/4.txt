Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me 'cause I'm fuckin' with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I'm shinin' all week, ho
I'm sippin' Clicquot and rockin' yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in the watch I can't tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, 'cause every nigga that I'm with Taylor'd
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin', "That's nothin'"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can't get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats
Smoke weed, count stacks, get fly
Take trips and that's that, real rap
