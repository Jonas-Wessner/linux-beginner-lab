Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin', "That's nothin'"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it, but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede insides, my engine roarin'
It's the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checkin' game, I'm ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breakin' hearts
No keys, push to start
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screamin', "That's nothin'"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow
Black and yellow
