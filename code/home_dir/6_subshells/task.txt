1. Use the echo command, a subshell and the date command to print the text 'It is now <date>', where 'date' is the current date and time. Redirect the output to a file called 'date.txt'
2. Use a subshell and the 'date +%y_%m_%d_%H' command to automatically create a file with the name '<year>_<month>_<day>_<hour>.log', where the in brackets encapsulated variables equal the attributes of the current point in time.
3. Check whether the entries with the ID 121 are equal for the file 'titanic_train_1.csv' and the file 'titanic_train_2.csv' using the egrep command and a subshell. Before you start, use the cat command to get an impression of the data in the files in order to decide how to search for the entry with this ID.
4. Repeat the third task with id 122
5. Use the command './check.sh' in this directory to verify your results for tasks 1 and 2
6. Compare your results for exercises 3 and 4 with those of the person next to you or check the file 'solution.txt'
